This was some finger practice and is not meant to be used in any production environment.
Use it as a reference to gather some ideas if you want to implement it yourself.

## Setup

1. `pipenv install` or `pipenv install --dev`
2. Play around with your prefered IDE (VSCode launch included)

## Test

Run pytest unit tests like `pipenv run pytest`
